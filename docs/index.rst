===================

UncertainSCI is a Python-based toolkit that harnesses modern techniques to estimate model and parametric uncertainty, with a particular emphasis on needs for biomedical simulations and applications. This toolkit enables non-intrusive integration of these techniques with well-established biomedical simulation software.
