About UncertainSCI
===================

UncertainSCI is a Python-based toolkit that harnesses modern techniques to estimate model and parametric uncertainty, with a particular emphasis on needs for biomedical simulations and applications. This toolkit enables non-intrusive integration of these techniques with well-established biomedical simulation software.


Currently implemented in UncertainSCI is Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE) with a number of input distributions.  For more information about these techniques, see: :cite:p:`JDT:Bur2020,narayan_computation_2018,guo_weighted_2018,cohen_optimal_2017`
